# ACC Project: Web Scraping Application

## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to build an application designed to monitor website changes, such as price drops and new internship opportunities. Our vision is to create an application that allows users to set preferences and receive real-time notifications through various channels, maintaining a database of updated information for easy and future reference. This is the Result-Focused continuation of the past Learning-Focused project, the legacy repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Beketovian/wsapp).

## Teams and Responsibilities

If you are a member of the project, you have been assigned to one of the three teams listed:

### Frontend Team

The Frontend Team is tasked with creating a seamless and responsive user interface, ensuring an engaging and accessible experience across different devices.

### Backend Team

The Backend Team is in charge of the core application logic, data processing, and the management of the database, ensuring robust and efficient back-end support for the front-end interface.

### Web Scraping Team

The Web Scraping Team focuses on the logic behind how to extract data from any website. They are responsible for writing and maintaining scripts that gather data, ensuring the application has the latest content.

## Current TODOs:

- ~~Implementing a user authentication system.~~
- ~~Add scraping functionality and user-specific object~~
- ~~Implement a sophisticated table for the user's scraped sites dashboard~~
- Add more pages to enhance frontend UI/UX
- Develop a notification system and interval scraping options
- Deploy the application for public access.
